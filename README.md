# Tetris

Modification of WPExplorer's Tetris WP Theme: http://www.wpexplorer.com/tetris-wordpress-theme/

I really liked this free theme for Wordpress minus the tumblr style front page. I decided to strip it down and make it in to a 1 column style blog layout.


## Changes thus far:
- Removed Soliloquy plugin references and from template (gallery slider)
- Removed sidebar from template on posts page

## Planned changes: 
- Change front page posts format to 1 column rather than tumblog
